Object Oriented Programming - Pillars and Examples

Types of Language
1. Procedural Language - 
2. Object oriented Language - OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

Four Pillar of Object oriented Programming

1. Data Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Data Abstraction 
  Defination - Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation
  Example - A man driving a car - Accelaration, Brake, Push Start and push Stop
  Achieved through - Abstract classes or Interfaces 

Encapsulation
  Defination - Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared
  Example - a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section. Let's say Finance section needs information about sales in particular month. Then data cannot be access directly. Needs to access throught person from sales team.
  Achieved through - Access Modifiers and Get Set Method

Inheritance
 Defination -  The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.
  Types - Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, MultiLevel Inheritance, Hierachical Inheritance and Hybrid Inheritance
  Example - Animal 
  Achieved through - Deriving the base class

Polymorphism 
  Defination - The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
  Types - 1. Compile time and 2. Run Time. Compile time - a. Function Overloading and b. Operator Overloading
  Exmaple - A man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee
  Achieved through - Virtual and Override keyword
